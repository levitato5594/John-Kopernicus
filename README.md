# John-Kopernicus
Official GitHub page for the JohnKopernicus tool.

Why John Kopernicus? Derivates from the online joke *John* as the *owner* or *creator* of something, having their last name being the name of the thing that they made/own and Kopernicus for the Kerbal Space Program mod of the same name, as this tool is intended to KSP modders using Kopernicus to bring their own worlds to reality.


# Utility
John Kopernicus is currently written in C, it allows a Kopernicus user to easily implement some characteristics into their mod. Only with simple copy-pasting from their configs to make life easier.

- Coordinate calculator
  - This option allows you to convert geographic coordinates to cartesian coordinates - Mostly used for KSC locations and PQSCity.
  
- Barycenter Calculator
  - This allows the user to easily calculate the mass of a barycenter and the distance of the binary planets around said barycenter to implement accurate bodies.
 
- SMA for Kerbin insulation
  - This option will give you the distance from your star where you will want to place your habitable planet to get a Kerbin-like average temperature.
 
- DeltaV calculations
  - This option is the most complex yet and features a ton of calculation to help planet modders create their own DeltaV map without any headaches, just copy paste a few values from your configs and voil√† ! You have the DeltaV requirements for interplanetary transfers including circularization dv and more !

Here's a small showcase of this option : https://youtu.be/xJ_eWcLpFZU

# Other

I am open to improvements and will gladly add any suggestions that would be useful for everyone. I will do my best to learn C# and make a more intuitive interface.
